New feature: DPK utility!
-------------------------

Now, because I haven't fully implemented it yet, you're required to run the demo.py first in order to generate the storage and storage instance information in storage.db, but after that, you can use the dpk.py utility to store, retrieve, and list files.

The storage instance generated by demo.py is called 'dropbox-defcon21', as part of the standard '<service>-<instance>' notation. 


### Fun Examples: ###

    ./dpk.py dropbox-defcon21 put <file>
    ./dpk.py dropbox-defcon21 list [partial string for searching]
    ./dpk.py dropbox-defcon21 get <internal_handle> [output_filename]
